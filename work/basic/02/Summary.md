## Main Commands and Features

### 1. Explain Code (`Explain`)
- Get a detailed explanation of a code snippet or entire file.
- Use by selecting code and requesting "Explain the code" or with a prompt like:
  ```bash
  Explain the code in file <filename>
  ```
- The explanation appears in the Chat window.

### 2. Refactor Code (`Refactor`)
- Improve code structure and readability, remove duplicates, and apply best practices.
- Request a general or rule-based refactor, for example:
  ```bash
  Refactor the code in file <filename>
  Refactor the code in file <filename> with the rule {rule}
  ```
- Providing specific rules yields better results.

### 3. Fix Code Errors (`Fix`)
- Detect and correct errors in source code.
- Paste code and add "Fix code errors" or use prompts like:
  ```bash
  Fix code errors in file <filename>
  /fix
  ```
- The result shows the corrected code and, if needed, an explanation of the changes.

### 4. Generate Code from Comments
- Create new code from structured comments (e.g., API requirements).
- Paste the comment and run the chat to get a code proposal.

### 5. Containerize Projects (`Dockerfile`)
- Copilot Chat can generate a `Dockerfile` to containerize Node.js or other projects, using prompts like:
  ```bash
  Containerize the previous project in a Dockerfile using the latest base image
  ```
